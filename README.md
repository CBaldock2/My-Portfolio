# My-Portfolio

## Description
My goal with building my portfolio was to have a place to store anything I create in class, and eventually after I graduate, in a neat organized manor. There are three main sections to this page; an about me, a work, and a contact information. The about me has a picture of me and a summary of me. The work has screenshots of my past work, and are labeled. The contact me section has my cell phone number, my email address and my LinkedIn. I challenged myself to learn more in the areas I felt I could do better in so that my portfolio looked good.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To use my portfolio you click on a button in the navbar it will scroll down the page to the respective area. Clicking on a image in the work section will redirct you to the deployed webpage of my past work. Also, I have my LinkedIn  page linked so once you click on that you'll be redircted to my LinkedIn. I have two seperate media queries depending on the size of the screen the page will look different. There are three diffent ways my page will look, the first is if the page is at 992px or higher, the second is between 991px and 768px and lastly if the device screen is under 767px it will have a third layout.
